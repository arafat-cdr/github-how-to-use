### Open a Pull Request
* Pull requests are a key part of GitHub. A Pull Request notifies people you have changes ready for them to consider or review.
* You can ask others to review your changes or pull your contribution and merge it into their branch. 

### Review
* When a Pull Request is made, it can be reviewed by whoever has the proper access to the branch. This is where good discussions and review of the changes happen.

* Pull Requests are designed to allow people to work together easily and produce better results together!

* If you receive feedback and continue to improve your changes, you can push your changes with new commits, making further reviews possible.

*** Note: GitHub shows new commit and feedback in the "unified Pull Request view". ***


### Deploy
* When the pull request has been reviewed and everything looks good, it is time for the final testing. GitHub allows you to deploy from a branch for final testing in production before merging with the master branch.

* If any issues arise, you can undo the changes by deploying the master branch into production again!

*** Note: Teams often have dedicated testing environments used for deploying branches. ***

### Merge
* After exhaustive testing, you can merge the code into the master branch!

* Pull Requests keep records of changes to your code, and if you commented and named changes well, you can go back and understand why changes and decisions were made.

*** Note: You can add keywords to your pull request for easier searching! ***
